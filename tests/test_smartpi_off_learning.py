"""Test for SmartPI OFF learning logic (b parameter) with trimming and robustness checks.

This test file simulates various temperature curves during OFF periods to verify:
1. Rejection of inertia (initial rise/flat) via trimming.
2. Rejection of plateau (end flat) via trimming.
3. Rejection of flat lines (noise only) via min slope check.
4. Correct skipping of learning when slope is invalid (Option A).
