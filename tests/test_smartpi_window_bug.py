    Test reproduction and fix for the Negative Integral Spike on Window Close.
    
    Scenario:
    1. Thermostat in HEAT mode, steady state, inside Deadband (_in_deadband=True).
    2. Window Opens -> HVAC_MODE_OFF.
    3. Window Closes -> HVAC_MODE_HEAT (Resume).
    4. Temperature has dropped significantly (Exit Deadband).
    
    Expected Behavior (Fixed):
    - Upon resume, the algorithm should NOT trigger Bumpless Transfer because _in_deadband should have been reset to False.
    - Integral should start at 0.0 (or be calculated normally), NOT jump to a massive negative value.
    
    Bug Behavior (Unfixed):
    - _in_deadband remains True during OFF.
    - Resume triggers "Deadband Exit" -> Bumpless Transfer.
    - u_prev is 0.0 (from OFF).
    - Calculated Integral = (0 - Kp*Error)/Ki  -> Massive Negative Value (e.g. -800).
